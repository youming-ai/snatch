 * Optional API-key gate for self-hosted instances.

 * When `API_KEY` is unset (the default) the middleware is a no-op and the API
 * stays public — preserving existing behavior. When set, every `/api/*`
 * request must carry `Authorization: Api-Key <value>` matching the configured
 * secret via a constant-time compare, matching the scheme the web client
 * already sends.
 *
 * Mount AFTER rateLimit so even unauthenticated probes are counted against the
 * abuse budget. CORS preflight (OPTIONS) is short-circuited by the cors
 * middleware upstream, but we skip OPTIONS defensively too.
